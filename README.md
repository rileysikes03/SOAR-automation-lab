# SOAR Automation Project 

## Objective
The SOAR Automation Lab project aimed to create a comprehensive environment for Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR). This project integrated various tools including a Security Operations Center (SOC) simulation (Wazuh), Case Management (The Hive), and SOAR capabilities (Shuffle) to automate and manage security incidents efficiently.

### Skills Learned
- Practical experience in setting up and configuring a SOAR environment.
- Hands-on exposure to integrating SIEM with case management and SOAR platforms.
- Automation scripting for responsive capabilities.
- Troubleshooting and error resolution in a complex cyber security environment.
- Documentation and communication skills through project updates and reports.

### Tools Used
- Wazuh: Simulation environment for SOC activities.
- The Hive: Case management system for incident handling.
- Shuffle: SOAR platform for automation and orchestration.
- DigitalOcean: Cloud infrastructure for scalable deployment.

This diagram illustrates the logical setup of the SOAR Automation Lab, outlining components like Wasa, The Hive, and Shuffle.

### Step 2: Installation and Setup
![Cloud Setup]
Deployment of components in the cloud environment, configuring virtual machines for Wasa, The Hive, and Shuffle.

### Step 3: Server Configuration
![Server Configuration]
Configuration of servers and endpoints to facilitate communication between Wasa, The Hive, and other network components.

### Step 4: Telemetry Generation
![Telemetry Generation]
Generating telemetry data to mimic real attack scenarios, configuring alerts within Wasa to trigger on specific incidents.

### Step 5: SOAR Integration
![SOAR Integration]
Integration of Wasa alerts with The Hive for incident management, automating response actions using Shuffle.
